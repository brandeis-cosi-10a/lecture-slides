# cosi-10a

## Repository organization

This repository contains lecture slides for Cosi-10a, in Python notebook form. The notebooks are found under `lectures/notebooks`. 

A pre-commit hook (in `.hooks`) exists to automatically generate both vanilla html and reveal.js html slides when committing changes to notebooks. These versions are stored under `lectures/html`.

Run `git config core.hooksPath .hooks` after checking out to enable this pre-commit hook. 

## Lecture content

The content is roughly split up by topic. Many topics span multiple 80 
minute lecture periods. As of Spring '24, there are also several more 
topics than would fit into a normally paced semester. 

## Future work

Each topic needs supplemental exercises for reinforcement and practice. 
Many topics have some of these supplemental exercises included the notebooks. 

In the future, the plan is to separate (and probably break them down into 
smaller units) and the core information presentation from the supplemental
exercises, and add more supplemental exercises that can be pulled in as 
needed.
